Presidential Schools in Uzbekistan

Presidential Schools are specialized state educational institutions established in Uzbekistan at the initiative of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Between 2019 and 2021, 14 such schools were opened across the country.

History

On November 16, 2018, during a visit to Karakalpakstan, President Mirziyoyev announced plans to open Presidential Schools in each region. A resolution was signed four months later. In 2019, the “Regulation on Presidential Schools” and the decree creating the “Presidential Agency for the Development of Creative and Specialized Schools” were approved. In 2021, it was renamed the “Presidential Agency for Educational Institutions.”
The first schools opened in 2019 in Tashkent, Nukus, Namangan, and Khiva. More schools began operating in 2021 in Karshi, Samarkand, Andijan, Fergana, Termez, Bukhara, Navoi, Jizzakh, Nurafshon, and Gulistan.

Admission

Students who have completed grade 4 and achieved excellent results in STEAM subjects may apply to the Presidential School in their region. Each school admits 24 students into grade 5 annually, divided into two classes.

Admission Process:

Document Submission: Applicants upload documents (copy of birth certificate, photo - 3x4 taken in last 2 months , grade sheet, passport of parent) via the agency’s website - https://ariza.piima.uz/. Errors must be corrected within 48 hours.

Entrance Exams: Conducted under strict supervision, exams have two stages:

Stage 1: 30 math questions.

Stage 2: Tests in critical thinking, problem-solving, and English.
Exams are managed by “Cambridge Assessment,” and results are final.
